            <h2>SIP Calculator</h2>
            <p>A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) calculator helps you estimate the returns on your regular investments over a period of time. It takes into account the power of compounding, which can significantly increase your wealth over the long term.</p>
            
            <div class="calculator-card">
                <h3>How SIP Works</h3>
                <p>When you invest through a SIP, you commit to investing a fixed amount at regular intervals (typically monthly). This investment strategy offers several advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rupee Cost Averaging:</strong> By investing a fixed amount regularly, you buy more units when prices are low and fewer when prices are high, potentially lowering your average cost per unit over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Power of Compounding:</strong> Your returns generate their own returns over time, creating a snowball effect for your wealth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disciplined Investing:</strong> Regular automatic investments help you maintain investment discipline without timing the market.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Math Behind SIP Calculations</h3>
                <p>The SIP calculator uses the following formula to calculate your expected returns:</p>
                
                <div class="formula-box">
                    FV = P × ((1 + r)<sup>n</sup> - 1) × (1 + r) ÷ r
                </div>
                
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>FV</strong> = Future Value (final investment value)</li>
                    <li><strong>P</strong> = SIP investment amount</li>
                    <li><strong>r</strong> = Rate of return per period (annual rate ÷ 12 for monthly SIP)</li>
                    <li><strong>n</strong> = Total number of periods (investment duration in months)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Example Calculation</h3>
                <div class="example-calculation">
                    <p><strong>Monthly SIP amount:</strong> ₹5,000</p>
                    <p><strong>Expected annual return:</strong> 12%</p>
                    <p><strong>Investment period:</strong> 5 years (60 months)</p>
                    <p><strong>Step-up rate:</strong> 10% annually</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Calculation:</strong></p>
                    <p>For the first year: r = 12% ÷ 12 = 1% per month</p>
                    <p>After first year (12 months): ₹5,000 × ((1 + 0.01)<sup>12</sup> - 1) × (1 + 0.01) ÷ 0.01 = ₹63,412</p>
                    <p>For the second year: Monthly SIP increases to ₹5,500 (10% step-up)</p>
                    <p>By the end of 5 years with annual step-ups, total invested would be ₹3,66,312, and estimated value would be ₹4,87,417 <i>(assuming each year begin with January and ends with December)</i> </p>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
                    <p>Starting early is one of the most powerful ways to build wealth. Even small increases in your investment period can lead to significantly larger returns due to compounding.</p>

            <h2>Advanced SIP Calculator</h2>
            <p>The Advanced SIP Calculator extends the functionality of the Simple SIP Calculator by allowing you to customize your investment frequency, step-up type, and account for inflation.</p>
            
            <div class="calculator-card">
                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexible Investment Frequency:</strong> Choose between monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly investments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customizable Step-up Options:</strong> Select between percentage or fixed amount increases and choose how often to increase your investment.</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h3>How Inflation Is Calculated</h3>
                <p>The calculator adjusts your final investment value for inflation using this formula:</p>
                
                <div class="formula-box">
                    Real Value = Future Value ÷ (1 + i)<sup>t</sup>
                </div>
                
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real Value</strong> = Inflation-adjusted value</li>
                    <li><strong>Future Value</strong> = Projected investment value</li>
                    <li><strong>i</strong> = Annual inflation rate</li>
                    <li><strong>t</strong> = Total investment period in years</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Example Calculation</h3>
                <div class="example-calculation">
                    <p><strong>Monthly SIP amount:</strong> ₹15,000</p>

                    <p>Total invested: ₹28,68,736</p>
                    <p>Future value: ₹50,61,489</p>

                    <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
                    <p>When setting your expected returns, aim to use a rate that's at least 2-3% higher than the expected inflation rate to ensure real growth in your purchasing power.</p>

            <div class="calculator-card">
                <h3>How Lump Sum Investment Works</h3>
                <p>Unlike SIP where you invest regular amounts, a lump sum investment is a one-time investment of a larger amount. This approach has its own advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full Market Exposure:</strong> Your entire investment benefits from market growth right from the start.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compounding Benefits:</strong> The entire amount starts compounding immediately.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lower Transaction Costs:</strong> A single transaction may incur lower costs than multiple SIP transactions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Math Behind Lump Sum Calculations</h3>
                <p>The Lump Sum calculator uses the compound interest formula:</p>
                
                <div class="formula-box">
                    A = P(1 + r)<sup>t</sup>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A</strong> = Final amount</li>
                    <li><strong>P</strong> = Principal (initial investment)</li>
                    <li><strong>r</strong> = Annual rate of return (decimal)</li>
                    <li><strong>t</strong> = Time period in years</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Understanding EMI Calculation</h3>
                <p>EMI consists of both principal repayment and interest payment. In the early years of a loan, a larger portion of each EMI goes toward interest payment, while in later years, more goes toward reducing the principal.</p>
                
                <h3>The Math Behind EMI Calculations</h3>
                <p>The standard EMI formula is:</p>
                
                <div class="formula-box">
                    EMI = P × r × (1 + r)<sup>n</sup> ÷ [(1 + r)<sup>n</sup> - 1]
                </div>
                
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>P</strong> = Loan principal amount</li>
                    <li><strong>r</strong> = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100)</li>
                    <li><strong>n</strong> = Total number of monthly installments</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Step-up EMI Feature</h3>
                <p>The calculator also offers a step-up EMI option, where your EMI amount increases periodically. This is useful for young professionals who expect their income to grow over time.</p>
                
                <h3>Example Calculation</h3>
                <div class="example-calculation">
                    <p><strong>Loan amount:</strong> ₹30,00,000</p>
                    <p><strong>Annual interest rate:</strong> 8%</p>
                    <p><strong>Loan tenure:</strong> 20 years</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
                    <p>Monthly EMI: ₹25,093</p>
                    <p>Total interest paid: ₹30,22,318</p>
                    <p>Total payment: ₹60,22,318</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Prepayment Benefits</h3>
                <p>The calculator allows you to simulate loan prepayments and see their impact:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced total interest payment</li>
                    <li>Shortened loan tenure</li>
                    <li>Lower financial burden in the long run</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
                    <p>Making prepayments during the early years of your loan has a much greater impact on reducing total interest than prepayments made later. Even small additional payments can significantly reduce your interest burden.</p>
